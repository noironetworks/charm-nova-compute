summary: OpenStack Compute - Nova compute hypervisor
maintainer: OpenStack Charmers <openstack-charmers@lists.ubuntu.com>
description: |
  OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
  addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon
  EC2 API.
  .
  This charm provides the Nova Compute hypervisor service and should be deployed
  directly to physical servers.
